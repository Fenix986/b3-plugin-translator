Description
-----------
This plugin is capable of translating in-game messages (chat) using Google Translate API or Microsoft Translator API

Installation
------------

 * copy translator.py into b3/extplugins
 * copy translator.xml into b3/extplugins/conf
 * edit your b3.xml config file adding :
 
<plugin name="translator" config="@b3/extplugins/conf/translator.xml"/>

If you plan to use the Microsoft Translator API service you need to:

1) Register a Windows Live ID -> https://signup.live.com/
2) While logged with your Windows Live ID, create an Account on the Azure Data Market -> https://datamarket.azure.com/developer/applications/
3) Go to the Microsoft Translator Data Service and Pick a Plan (The free one is 2.000.000 chars each month) -> https://datamarket.azure.com/dataset/1899a118-d202-492c-aa16-ba21c33c06cb
4) Register an Azure application ->https://datamarket.azure.com/developer/applications
5) While registering the new application u need to specify a "valid" website and a "valid" software name. You can just use as website "https://localhost" and as software name.....well you can enter whatever you want (we do love microsoft ^^ xD)

The Azure Application registration, provides two critical fields for API access:

Client ID
Client Secret

Put those credentials inside the translator.xml config file (be sure not to add spaces before and after)
